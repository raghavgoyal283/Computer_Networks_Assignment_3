THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY SOUTHEAST ASIA PROGRAM


The Southeast Asia Program was organized at Cornell University in the
Department of Far Eastern Studies in 1950. It is a teaching and
research program of interdisciplinary studies in the humanities, social
sciences, and some natural sciences. It deals with Southeast Asia as a
region, and with the individual countries of the area: Brunei, Burma,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.

The activities of the Program are carried on both at Cornell and in
Southeast Asia. They include an undergraduate and graduate curriculum
at Cornell which provides instruction by specialists in Southeast Asian
cultural history and present-day affairs and offers intensive training
in each of the major languages of the area. The Program sponsors group
research projects on Thailand, on Indonesia, on the Philippines, and on
the area’s Chinese minorities. At the same time, individual staff and
students of the Program have done field research in every Southeast
Asian country.

A list of publications relating to Southeast Asia which may be obtained
on prepaid order directly from the Program is given at the end of this
volume. Information on Program staff, fellowships, requirements for
degrees, and current course offerings will be found in an Announcement
of the Department of Asian Studies, obtainable from the Director,
Southeast Asia Program, 120 Uris Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, New
York 14850.

PREFACE


This work is a dictionary of Cebuano Visayan, the language of the
central part of the Philippines and much of Mindanao. Although the
explanations are given in English, the aim of this work is not to
provide English equivalents but to explain Cebuano forms in terms of
themselves. It is meant as a reference work for Cebuano speakers and as
a tool for students of the Cebuano language. There is a total of some
25,000 entries and an addenda of 700 forms which were prepared after
the dictionary had been composed.

This dictionary is the product of eleven years work by more than a
hundred persons. The work was edited by me and is my responsibility,
but the sources are entirely native, and all illustrations are composed
by native speakers. The personnel who wrote up the entries are listed
in Section 2.1, p. ix. The manuscript went through five versions, the
final on an IBM selectric composer. The whole composition was done in
Cebu City in five months’ time by Pacifico Briones, Nicolasito
Catingan, Florecita Florido, Donata Laingo, and Grace Mendoza. The
drafting and splicing were done by Carlito Gubaynon and Felismeno
Simplicio. The proofreading and editing was done by me together with
Mrs. Elizabeth Say, Mrs. Fe Cuenca, Richard Quiñanola, and my wife Ida
Wolff. In the earlier stages of gathering, transcribing, and indexing
materials a huge number of people participated, too numerous to mention
by name. The entire dictionary through the final composed product was
compiled from notes on index cards in the course of twenty-six months.
My thanks go especially to the staff listed above and on p. ix for
their cooperative spirit. Without their willingness to work overtime,
this dictionary could not have been completed.

The work was supported from 1963 to 1966 by funds from Cornell
University faculty research grants; 1966–7 by Office of Education
contract No. 1-7-002672-2040; 1967–1968 by a Cornell University
faculty research grant; 1968–1969 by a grant from the American
Council of Learned Societies and by a grant from the Cornell University
Philippine Project; 1969–1971 by Office of Education Contract No.
0-9-097718-3350. My trip to the Philippines was financed in 1966–1969
and again in 1970–71 by a Fulbright-Hayes faculty research grant.
Without these sources of funds this dictionary could not have been
completed.

This dictionary by no means exhausts the Cebuano language, and we hope
in future years to produce an expanded and improved version with
illustrations. To this end we welcome and would be most grateful for
suggestions for corrections and additions.

FOREWORD


The Southeast Asia Program takes particular pleasure in helping to make
this Cebuano dictionary available. The language is, of course, of
importance in itself, not only because of its wide use in the
Philippines, but also because of its value to linguists and historical
research.

In addition, we are especially pleased that this dictionary is a joint
publication of the Southeast Asia Program and the Linguistic Society of
the Philippines. We owe a special debt of gratitude to the Rev. Teodoro
Llamzon, S. J., president of the Linguistic Society of the Philippines,
for his gracious help and cooperation in attending to the many details
involved in such a cooperative venture. We are also grateful to the
Asia Foundation, which provided a partial subsidy to make publication
possible.

We are confident that Professor Wolff’s research on Cebuano and the
compilation of this work, covering a period of eleven years, has
resulted in a useful reference work and in an important contribution to
our knowledge of Philippine languages and cultures and to linguistics
in general.

INTRODUCTION


1.0 Cebuano


This work is a dictionary of Cebuano Visayan, here called Cebuano for
short. Cebuano is spoken in the central portions of the Philippines: on
the islands of Cebu and Bohol, on the eastern half of Negros, western
half of Leyte, along the northern coasts of Mindanao, and on smaller
islands in the vicinity of these areas. A large portion of the urban
population of Zamboanga, Davao, and Cotabato is Cebuano speaking.
Cebuano is also widely spoken throughout the lowland areas of the
entire eastern third of Mindanao, where it is spreading at the expense
of the native languages (most of which are closely related to Cebuano).
Cebuano is the trade language in most places in Mindanao where
Cebuano-speaking populations and populations speaking other languages
are in contact.

Cebuano is also called Sugbuanon and is one of more than a dozen
languages or dialects which are given the name Bisayan or Visayan.
Other types of Visayan are spoken in areas surrounding the
Cebuano-speaking area on the north, east, west, and southeast. This
dictionary is confined to Cebuano forms and does not include forms
which are not Cebuano from other languages called Visayan spoken
outside of the area we have delineated.

In the areas where Cebuano is native and, to a large extent, also in
areas where Cebuano is a trade language, it is used for almost every
aspect of daily life and for most formal occasions: radio-TV, social
life, religious life, business, and the first two grades of school.
Cebuano is also largely used in the later grades, although English is
supposed to be the medium of instruction. In these areas Cebuano
language publications enjoy a wide readership.

Somewhere between one-quarter and one-third of the population of the
Philippines speaks Cebuano natively. [1] But despite its numerical
importance and wide use Cebuano lags far behind Tagalog (Pilipino) in
prestige and development as a means of literary and scientific
expression. In the schools the emphasis is almost entirely English:
Cebuano composition is not a school subject, and students read nothing
in Cebuano after the first two grades. In prestige Cebuano is losing
ground: for the upper and middle class elite, with isolated
praiseworthy exceptions, eloquence in Cebuano is not admired. In fact
it is almost a matter of pride not to know Cebuano well. Thus, despite
a phenomenal increase in literacy and in the total number of potential
contributors and participants in Cebuano literature, output has
declined in quantity and quality at an ever increasing rate over the
past two generations. The cultivation and development of Cebuano is
left to the least influential segments of the population, to whom
English education and exposure to English publications are minimally
available. These people still compose the vast majority of the
population, but the influential classes that have grown up knowing only
a dilute and inarticulate Cebuano are ever increasing in number,
proportion, and prestige.



1.1 Dialects

The Cebuano language is remarkably uniform. There are differences, to
be sure, but these differences are no greater than the differences
found among the various varieties of English spoken around the world.
There are scattered places within the Cebuano area which use a speech
widely aberrant from what we describe here: Surigao, Bantayan Islands,
and the Camotes Islands. Forms peculiar to those areas we have simply
omitted except for a few widely used forms which tend to find their way
into standard Cebuano as spoken by natives of these areas. Such forms
are listed, but marked ‘dialectal’. Otherwise whatever forms we
have found we have listed without comment, whether or not they are in
current use throughout the Cebuano speech area.



1.12 Correct and incorrect speech

A happy consequence of the low regard which Cebuano speakers have of
their own language is that the doctrine of correctness has never gained
foothold. Dialectal differences are purely local, not social, [2] and
speakers regard whatever forms they are familiar with as correct. We
have followed the same principle in this dictionary: no attempt is made
to prescribe which forms or usages are appropriate, but rather we try
to show which forms and usages occur. The various meanings of a given
form are listed in such a way that their relation is readily
discernible: meanings which are derived by extension or specialization
from an original meaning are listed under subheadings of the
original-meaning. [3]

Occasionally annotations such as ‘slang’, ‘euphemism’,
‘humorous’, ‘coarse’, and the like, are given. These
annotations signal only that Cebuano speakers tend to regard these
forms as such and that they occur only in styles of speech appropriate
to these forms. [4] We use the following terminology: Biblical,
literary, metaphorical, humorous, euphemism, coarse, colloquial. The
designation BIBLICAL indicates a form confined to liturgical language
or the Bible; LITERARY indicates a form confined to high-flown styles,
not ordinarily spoken; METAPHORICAL indicates a meaning recognized as
metaphorical in some way (not necessarily confined to literary style);
HUMOROUS, a meaning commonly given to a form, but not the primary
meaning, which gives the feeling of an oft-repeated joke; EUPHEMISM, a
form that is used to avoid saying s.t directly, the meaning of which is
readily understood but not as jarring as if it had been said directly;
COARSE, a form that clearly would jar the hearer and that is confined
to speech used in anger or used as a sign of intimacy or disrespect;
SLANG indicates a form confined to intimate speech among people of
similar occupations or life styles; COLLOQUIAL indicates forms avoided
in formal discourse or writing, but commonly used in normal speech even
among non-intimates.




2.0 Basis of this work


This dictionary is a comprehensive listing of approximately 25,000
Cebuano roots with English explanations of their meanings and uses and
an indication of the affixational system to which each root is subject,
with ample illustrations. Most of the forms here listed are taken from
written sources or from taped oral sources of Cebuano of nearly a
million words, gathered from all over the Cebuano speech area and
covering a wide range of topics and styles. The written sources are
some 400 issues of Cebuano publications: Bisaya, Silaw, and Bag-ong
Suga, a few novenas, novels, and other collections that have been
published. [5] About ninety percent of the forms here listed come from
these oral or printed sources. Forms which did not occur in these
sources but which were well known to me or at least one of the members
of the staff that composed this dictionary are also included. Further,
any form which occurred in our sources which was not known to our
personnel was not included. [6] Although there are numerous published
sources of Cebuano forms—dictionaries and anthropological and
biological studies, we have not taken any forms from them that could
not be confirmed directly from our texts or informants.



2.1 Personnel

The collection, transcription, and classification of the texts was
carried out by a large staff in Cebu City, originating from all over
the Cebuano speech area. The final stage, the writing up of the
definitions, was carried by a small staff, exclusively native speakers
of Cebuano now resident in Cebu: Miss E. Agapay, of Malitbog, Leyte,
but also a long time resident of Talibon, Bohol, and in Guihulngan,
Negros Oriental; Nicolas Ampatin, of Malitbog, Leyte; Abel Angus, of
Tudela, Camotes; José Dioko, of Malaboyoc, Cebu; Mrs. E. Emnace, of
Dumanjug, Cebu; Atty. A. Estorco, of Guihulngan, Negros Oriental;
Everett Mendoza, of Maasin, Leyte; Mrs. D. Ag. Villondo, of Dumanjug,
Cebu, but also a long time resident of Ozamis City, and Molave,
Zamboanga del Sur.



2.2 Other sources

The scientific names for plants and shells are based upon specimens
which were gathered and identified with their Cebuano names by reliable
informants. The specimens were compared against the available
literature, and where identification was certain, scientific names were
given. Our scientific names for plants are taken from the following
sources (in order—plants not listed in the first were referred to the
second, those not in the first or second were referred to the third,
and so forth): Brown, Quisumbing, Merrill, Steiner. For shellfish, we
give no scientific names but follow the English terminology of Abbott,
1962. For the fishes and birds, we relied mainly on pictures for
Cebuano identification. For fish available in the local markets, we
could examine actual specimens. The scientific names of fish follow
those given by Herre (1953) and for birds by Delacour and Myer.

We made heavy use of the anthropological sources listed in the
bibliography but independently checked all information incorporated and
used terminology listed in them only insofar as we could corroborate
it.




3.0 Phonology and transcription


The following chart gives the Cebuano phonemes and the articulation:

    +---------------+--------+--------------+-------+------+-------+
    |                           Vowels                             |
    +----------------------+---------------+-----------------------+
    |  high- or mid-front  |  low central  |   high- or mid-back   |
    |         i            |       a       |           u           |
    +----------------------+---------------+-----------------------+

In addition there is a fourth mid-central vowel which occurs
dialectally (Bohol, Southern Leyte, Southern Cebu, and other scattered
areas) but is not found in the dialect of Cebu City and is not
transcribed here. [7] The palatal stop /j/ in many dialects does not
contrast with the cluster /dy/. In the dialect of the Camotes Islands
there is also a voiced spirant /z/ which derives historically from /y/
but contrasts with /y/ currently.

Vowels may be long or short. Contrast between long and short vowels
occurs only in the final and the penultimate syllable of the word:
káun [kā́ʔun] ‘eat’ and nagdá [nagdā́] ‘is bringing’.
Further, there is only one long vowel per word. There is also a phoneme
of stress which has a very low contrastive function. For the most part
stress can be determined by the phonological make-up of the word: 1
stress falls on the long vowel of the word if the word has a long
vowel: nagdá [nagdā́], káun [kā́ʔun]. 2 for words that have no
long vowel, stress is on the penultimate if it is closed: tan-aw
[tánʔaw] ‘see’; mugbù [múgbuʔ] ‘short’. If the penultimate
is open and short, stress is on the ultimate: mala [malá] ‘dry’.
Occasionally, in words with a closed penult the final syllable is
stressed (marked here with a wedge): mandǎr [mandár] ‘order’;
dughǐt [dughít] ‘instrument for poking’. In words with a long
vowel in the ultimate syllable there is, in some dialects, a contrast
between the stress on the first mora and stress on the second mora of
the long vowel: nahū́g [nahúug] ‘fell’; húg [huúg] ‘woof’.
This contrast does not obtain in all dialects.



3.2 Transcription

The transcription here adopted adheres as closely as possible to the
spelling found in Cebuano publications and at the same time is strictly
phonemic—that is, each phoneme is indicated, and no phoneme in a
given environment is given more than one transcription. Our
transcription follows the phonemic symbols given in the Chart 3.0 with
the exceptions listed in the following sections.



3.21 Vowels

We write only three vowels: i, u, a. In Cebuano publications /i/ is
sometimes written i, sometimes e, but with no consistency; and /u/
sometimes is written u, sometimes o (again with no consistency). But
here the letters e and o are not used.

Long vowels are indicated with an acute accent: nagdá [nagdā́] ‘is
bringing’, lána [lā́na] ‘coconut oil’. (Cebuano publications
occasionally indicate long vowels by doubling them, but most frequently
long vowels are ignored.)

Stress is not indicated if the placement is according to the rules
given in Section 3.0, above. Where a word with a closed penult has a
stress on the final syllable, this fact is indicated by a wedge:
mandǎr [mandár] ‘order’. For words with a long vowel in the final
syllable where the stress is on the final mora, the acute accent
indicates the long vowel and stress on the final mora: húg [huúg]
‘woof, trák [traák] ‘bus’. For words with a long vowel in the
final syllable where the stress is on the first mora, the stress on the
first mora and length are indicated by a combination of a long mark and
acute accent: nahū́g [nahúug] ‘fell’, ang-ā́ng [ʔangʔáang]
‘not quite’.



3.22 Glottal stop /ʔ/

In Cebuano publications /ʔ/ is only sometimes indicated. [8] Here we
indicate /ʔ/ in word or syllable final position with a grave accent
written over the vowel which precedes the glottal stop: walà /waláʔ/
‘no’, bàbà /báʔbaʔ/ ‘mouth’, làhib /láʔhib/
‘slice’. (In Cebuano publications the glottal stop of these words
is never indicated.)

In post-consonantal position we indicate /ʔ/ with a hyphen, as is done
in most Cebuano publications: tan-aw /tanʔaw/ ‘see’. In other
positions—that is, intervocalically and in word initial position,
glottal stop is not written, as is also the usual practice in Cebuano
publications: writing of two adjacent vowels or initial vowel serves to
indicate a glottal stop: [9] maáyu /maʔā́yu/ ‘good’, alas
/ʔalás/ ‘ace’.



3.23 /ŋ/, /c/, /j/, /dy/, /ty/

The phoneme /ŋ/ is transcribed ng, as in Cebuano publications: bángun
/báŋun/ ‘get up’. The sequence /ng/ is transcribed n-g: san-glas
/sanglas/ ‘sunglasses’.

/c/ is transcribed ts, as in Cebuano publications: tsinílas /cinílas/
‘slippers’ [10]. The sequence /ty/ is transcribed ty (as in Cebuano
publications): tyanggi /tyánggi/ ‘market’.

The phoneme /j/ is transcribed initially and medially as dy: dyíp
/jíp/ ‘jeep’, dyus /jus/ ‘juice’. (In Cebuano publications /j/
is sometimes written dy, sometimes diy: diyip or dyip—i.e. the
spelling of /j/ is no different from that of /dy/.) In final position
/j/ is transcribed ds, following the usage in Cebuano publications:
dyurds /jurj/ ‘a name—George’. [11] The sequence /dy/ is
transcribed diy: diyus /dyus/ ‘god’. (This sequence is spelled diy
or, alternatively, dy in Cebuano publications.) [12]



3.24 Ciy and Cy; Cuw and Cw; ayi and ay; awu and aw

The contrast between /Ciy/ and /Cy/ and between /Cuw/ and /Cw/ (where C
is any consonant) obtains only in the position where the /y/ or /w/
precedes a vowel of the final syllable (e.g. paliya [paliyá] ‘k.o.
vegetable’ vs. palya [pálya] ‘fail’). When the /y/ or /w/
precedes a vowel of the penultimate or earlier syllable, the contrast
does not obtain. If one consonant precedes the /y/ or /w/ we write Cy
and Cw; biyà ‘leftovers’ but hibyaan /hi-byà-an/ ‘be left
behind’; guwà ‘go out’, higwaan ‘gone out from’. If two
consonants precede the /y/ or /w/ we write Ciy and Cuw respectively:
pinsiyunáda ‘one who receives a pension’, nagkuwarisma ‘have a
sad expression’ (but Kwarisma ‘Lent’).

Similarly, the contrast between /Vyi/ and /Vy/ or /Vwu/ and /Vw/ (where
V is any vowel) obtains only when the /y/ or /yi/, /w/ or /wu/ are
final in the word: bay ‘term of address’ vs. bayi ‘female’;
mabaw ‘shallow’ vs. hibawu (or hibáwu) ‘know’. In closed final
syllables or penultimate or earlier syllables the contrast does not
obtain. We write Vyi and Vwu in closed syllables and Viy and Vuw in
open syllables: bayinti ‘twenty’ but ayta ‘give me’; dawunggan
‘ear’ but awtu ‘car’.




4.0 Listing of Entries


Cebuano is a language with a complex system of affixation and
comparatively simple morphophonemic alternations. For this reason the
listing of forms is strictly by root. [13] Forms of the sort where the
root is not really evident are listed with a cross-reference to the
root. The order is strictly alphabetical with no regard to diacritical
markings (hyphens or accent marks) except that forms without
diacritical markings precede forms with diacritical markings.

The order of presentation is always root alone or root plus verbal
affixes (Section 6.1f.) followed by verbal derivations (Section 6.2),
followed by nominal and adjectival derivations, listed in alphabetical
order (Section 7.0). Most roots occur as several parts of speech, and
the determination of whether a root is basically a noun, adjective, or
verb depends upon a series of morphological and syntactic criteria the
details of which cannot be presented here. [14] Roots which are
basically adjectives are defined first as adjectives, then as nouns and
verbs. Roots, basically nouns, are defined first as nouns, then as
adjectives and verbs; and roots, basically verbs, are defined first as
verbs and then as nouns and adjectives. For verbal forms a formula
indicating the conjugation (set of inflectional affixes which may be
added to them) is given. The formulas are explained in Sections 7.1ff.
and 7.2ff. below.

The entries are liberally illustrated, with the primary aim of
clarifying the meaning and with a secondary aim of exemplifying the
morphological characteristics of the affixed forms.




5.0 Alternations

5.1 Morphophonemic alternations

Since the listing in this dictionary is strictly by root, an outline of
the important morphophonemic alternations is given here. In the entries
nonpredictable morphophonemic alternations are indicated by writing the
affixed forms out.



5.11 Shift of stress

The general rule is that an affixed form has the stress on the same
syllable as the root alone. Where this general rule is broken, there is
said to be SHIFT OF STRESS. When an affixed form has final stress where
the root had penultimate stress, there is said to be SHIFT TO THE FINAL
SYLLABLE, indicated by the symbol (→):


káun     /kā́ʔun/   ‘eat’  + nag-(→) =  nagkaun /nagkaʔún/  ‘is eating’
tugnaw   /túgnaw/  ‘cold’ + -un(→)  =  tugnawun /tugnawún/ ‘be cold’


When an affixed form has penultimate stress where the root had final
stress, there is said to be SHIFT TO THE PENULTIMATE SYLLABLE,
indicated by the symbol (←):


sakay /sakáy/ ‘ride’ + nag-(←)  =  nagsákay /nagsā́kay/ ‘ride together’


In many cases an unaffixed root has both final stress and penultimate
stress (depending on the meaning). Whichever stress occurs with the
prefix MU- (see the entry under MU-) is taken to be the stress of the
root. Thus, the formation of the unaffixed root with a different stress
pattern is said to be by the addition of an affix consisting of shift
of stress alone:


inúm [15] /ʔinúm/ ‘drink’  + (←) =  ínum /ʔī́num/  ‘drink heavily’
búnal     /búnal/ ‘beat’   + (→) =  bunal /bunál/ ‘club’



5.12 Dropping of vowels

When a suffix is added to a root with a stressed final syllable, the
tendency is to drop the vowel of the final syllable of the root:


dakup /dakúp/   arrest + -an   =  dakpan /dákpan/      be arrested
pisik /pisík/   splash + -an   =  piskan /pískan/      be splashed
lakat /lakát/   go     + -unun =  laktunun /laktunún/  errand


This occasionally also happens to roots with stressed penults:


kalímut /kalímut/  forget + -i =  kalimti /kalímti/    forget it



5.13   Adding of /h/ or /ʔ/ to roots ending in a vowel when a suffix
       is added

Some roots which end in a vowel add /ʔ/ before a suffix, some roots
add /h/, other roots add either /ʔ/ or /h/ (depending on which
suffix):


bása /bása/  read         + -un   = basáhun /basáhun/   be read
adtu /ʔádtu/  go          + -un   = adtúun /ʔadtū́ʔun/   gone to get
kabaláka /kabaláka/ worry + -an   = kabalak-an /kabalákʔan/  s.t. to
                                    worry about (with the vowel of
                                    the final syllable of the root
                                    dropped—5.12).
sulti /súlti/  talk       + -un   = sultíhun /sultī́hun/ talk it out
sulti /súlti/  talk       + -ánay = sultiánay /sultiʔā́nay/ conversation



5.14  Metathesis

In affixed forms, the sequences /ʔC/ and /hC/ (where C is any
consonant) almost always become /Cʔ/ and /Ch/: [16]


káun  /káʔun/  eat    + -a  = kan-a /kánʔa/ eat it (with the final
                              syllable of the root dropped).
luhud /luhúd/  kneel  + -an = ludhan /lúdhan/ kneel on (with the
                              vowel of the final syllable of the root
                              dropped).


The sequences /ʔVh/ usually becomes /hVʔ/ (where V is a vowel):


túu /túʔu/ believe + -an  =  tuhúan /tuhū́ʔan/ believable (where /h/
                             is intercalated by the rule of 5.13).


Sequences of a liquid or /s/ plus a consonant tend to be metathesized
when a suffix is added if the vowel of the final syllable of the root
is dropped.


ngálan /ŋálan/  name       + -an  =  nganlan /ŋánlan/  be named
sulud  /sulúd/  enter      + -un  =  sudlun  /súdlun/  enter it
inum   /ʔinúm/  drink      + -a   =  imna    /ʔímna/   drink it
putus  /putús/  wrap       + -un  =  pustun  /pústun/  wrap it
lusut  /lusút/  go through + -an  =  lutsan  /lū́can/   go through it


These alternations also manifest themselves in competing root forms:
alhu /ʔálhu/ and hal-u /halʔu/ ‘pestle’; kalamunggay and
kamalunggay ‘k.o. tree’.



5.15 Change of /r/ or /l/ to /d, g, h/

Intervocalically, /d/ usually becomes /r/ or, less frequently, /l/:


búkid mountain + ka-an  =  kabukíran or, alternatively, kabukílan
                           mountains


Vice versa, in roots with intervocalic /l/ or /r/, the /l/ or /r/ may
change to /d/ when final or abutting on a consonant.


walà  /waláʔ/  be lost + -un  =  wad-un /wadʔun/ lose s.t. (with loss
                                 of the final vowel of the root).
hurut /hurút/  use up  + -un  =  hutdun /hútdun/ use s.t. up (with
                                 metathesis).


When a /d/, /l/, or /r/ comes to abut on velar consonant it tends to
change to /g/: [17]


pálung  /páluŋ/ extinguish + -an  =  pagngan /págŋan/ extinguish it
haluk   /halúk/ kiss       + -an  =  hagkan  /hágkan/ kiss it


/r/ or, occasionally, /l/ at the end of a root may change to /h/ when
suffixes are added. These are almost always words of Spanish
provenience.


mantinil make do with + -an  =  mantinihan  make do with it
imbitar  invite       + -un  =  imbitahun   invite him



5.2 Competing forms

Because of sound changes which took place over portions of the
Cebuano-speaking areas but did not spread over the entire area and the
subsequent spread of forms which reflect these changes, there are
numerous competing forms which are of the same etymology and which
usually (but not always) have the same meaning. [18]

Forms which are the same in meaning and which are related to each other
in that one underwent the sound change and the other did not are
defined only once and cross reference is made. Some sound changes are
so common and regular that only the older form is listed, and it is to
be taken for granted that the form which shows the sound change also
normally occurs unless a statement to the contrary is made.



5.21   Dropping of /l/

5.211   Intervocalic /l/

Most (but not all) roots which contain an /l/ between /a/’s and
/u/’s compete with roots which lack /l/. The forms without /l/ are
used generally in the Northeastern portion of the Cebuano area: all
areas east of Cebu (Bohol, Masbate, Leyte and islands in between) and
on the northern half of Cebu. In the Southwestern areas (Negros,
southern half of Cebu and most of Mindanao, the /l/ forms predominate.

Between like vowels /l/ is dropped and the vowel is usually lengthened:
kalabaw or kábaw ‘water buffalo’; balay or báy ‘house’;
tutulu or tutú ‘three’. In closed syllables or in the case of /l/
beginning the antepenult, no compensatory lengthening takes place:
kalatkat or katkat ‘climb’; kalamunggay or kamunggay ‘k.o.
tree’.

Between /a/ and /u/ or /u/ and /a/, /l/ becomes /w/: lalum or lawum
‘deep’; sulab or suwab ‘blade’. The sequence /alu/ in the
antepenult and penult or earlier in the root becomes /u/ in Cebu and
northern Leyte but /awu/ in Bohol and southern Leyte: dalunggan or
dunggan or dawunggan ‘ear’.

This alternation is for the most part confined to the root. [19]
Otherwise, it is so regular that only the forms containing /l/ are
listed, and the presumption is made that the /l/ may be dropped unless
a note is made to the contrary. [20]



5.212   Post-consonantal /l/

There is a tendency to drop post-consonantal /l/ usually (but not
always) with compensatory lengthening of the vowel of the penult:
kinahanglan or kinahángan ‘need’; aplud or apud ‘astringent in
taste’; danglug or dángug or dangug ‘slippery’. The /l/-less
forms are most common in the areas which drop intervocalic /l/. The
dropping of post-consonantal /l/ is by no means as widespread as
dropping of intervocalic /l/, and alternative forms are listed.



5.213   Final /l/

In Bohol and southern Leyte there is a tendency for /al/ at the end of
a word to become /aw/ and /ul/ to become /u/: bagal or bagaw
‘shell’. In this case alternative forms are listed.



5.214  Change of /l/ to /y/

Historically, intervocalic /l/ in isolated dialects became /y/. Forms
with /y/ for /l/ have spread throughout the Cebuano-speaking area, and
some are in competition with /l/-retaining forms: tingáli or tingáyi
‘perhaps’; kalugpus or kayugpus (also kugpus—by the rule of
5.211) ‘fold the arms’. In this case, competing forms are listed
with cross reference.



5.22   Assimilation and metathesis

There is a tendency for nasal consonants which abut on consonants to be
assimilated: bungdul or bundul ‘poke’; hingbis or himbis
‘scales’; amgid or anggid (also ambid) ‘like’. This alternation
is sporadic, and competing forms are listed.

There is some competition between forms with voiced and forms with
voiceless consonants, where the competition derives from assimilation:
tikbas or tigbas ‘strike with a blade’; bukdu or bugdu ‘bulging
out’. Again the competing forms are listed.

There is also competition between forms which differ by virtue of
metathesis: bungdul or dungbul (and dumbul) ‘poke’; itsa or ista
‘throw’; bàgu /baʔgu/ or bag-u /bagʔu/ ‘new’. (Cf. Section
5.14.) Competing forms that differ by virtue of metathesis are listed
except for forms containing a sequence /Cʔ/ which invariably compete
with forms containing /ʔC/.



5.23   Change of vowels

The vowel of the antepenult sporadically may change to /a/: kumusta or
kamusta ‘how are, is’; batíis or bitíis ‘leg’. Occasionally
/a/ or /u/ is assimilated to a following /y/ or an /i/ in the following
syllable: biyà or bayà ‘leave’; musimus or misimus ‘lowly’.
In these cases competing forms are listed.



5.24  Change of /y/ to /dy/

In Bohol and Southern Leyte /y/ becomes /j/ (written dy). Some forms
with dy have spread throughout the Cebuano speech area or occur only in
the Bohol-Southern Leyte speech. Such forms are listed with dy. [21]
Other forms with dy are listed as with y, and the reader may conclude
that these forms have /dy/ in Bohol and Southern Leyte.



5.25   Competing forms where no sound change is involved

Roots which are not relatable by the above rules are given separate
definitions. The exception to this rule is equivalent names of flora
and fauna and technical terms which refer to exactly the same cultural
forms: e.g. gwayabanu, labanu, malabanu, síku karabaw are all the same
plant (Anona muricata); humagbus and hinablus both refer to the same
relationship.




6.1  Inflection

Verb forms are subject to the addition of a small list of affixes which
we call INFLECTIONAL AFFIXES. The inflectional affixes specify three
tenses: PAST, FUTURE, and SUBJUNCTIVE; four cases or voices: ACTIVE,
DIRECT PASSIVE, LOCAL PASSIVE, and INSTRUMENTAL PASSIVE; and two modes:
POTENTIAL and NONPOTENTIAL. The nonpotential forms are further broken
down into two aspects: PUNCTUAL and DURATIVE. The punctual-durative
distinction exists in all voices but is observed only in the active
voice. [22] In the passive voices punctual forms are used for all
meanings, except for literary or dialectal styles where the
durative-nondurative distinction is maintained. The following chart
shows these affixes. Their meanings are listed and exemplified in
entries in the dictionary listed under mu-, mag-1, maka-1, -un1, ma-1,
-an1, i-1.  [23] In the following chart commas indicate forms which are
in free variation (nearly synonymous and mutually substitutable). A
preceding hyphen indicates a suffix, following hyphen a prefix, and
hyphen in the middle, a circumfix. Dialectal affixes are not listed.
The asterisks mark forms which are not normally used in colloquial
speech.


                Future       Past              Subjunctive
Active

  Punctual      mu-          mi-, ni-, ning-,  mu-

  Potential     ma-, ika-    na-, gika-        ma-, ika-



6.2 Verbal derivation

The inflectional affixes are added not only to roots (forms containing
no other affixes) but also to derived bases (forms containing further
affixes). The productive affixes which are added to roots to form bases
which in turn may have inflectional affixes added to them are -ay, -an,
pa-, paN-, [24] ka-, hi-, ha-, hiN-, pakig-, paki-, panggi-, pani-,
paniN-1. These affixes are given entries in the dictionary and
exemplified there.

When the active inflectional affixes are added to verb bases which
contain some of these derivative prefixes, they undergo morphophonemic
alternations as shown in the following chart:


    together with       ni- (mi-, ning-)    mu- becomes
    prefix              becomes

    paN-                naN-                maN-
    pakig-              nakig-              makig-
    paniN-              naniN-              maniN-
    pani-               nani-               mani-
    panggi-             nanggi-             manggi-


These affixes are given entries and defined there.




7.0 Classification of roots according to their system of affixation


With the rich system of derivational and inflectional affixations to
which Cebuano roots are subject, there are literally hundreds of
different affixed forms for any given root. Since it is manifestly
impossible to list exhaustively all affixations for any given root, we
follow the principle here that PRODUCTIVE FORMATIONS are generally not
listed unless there is s.t. especial about their meanings or
morphophonemics. By PRODUCTIVE FORMATIONS we mean affixes which are
added to all, or almost all, members of a certain group of roots. For
example, the affix ka-an2 is added to any root which refers to a plant
to form a collective noun referring to a place where a group of that
type of plant is found. The formation, ka-[plant]-an, is not listed
except in cases where there is s.t. special about the affixation, as
for example kalubinhan ‘coconut grove’ (from lubi) which undergoes
special morphophonemics or kabaknitan ‘thicket’ (from baknit
‘k.o. vine’), where the meaning of the affixed form is not
predictable from the meaning of the base and the affixes. The following
productive affixes are listed only occasionally. For their meanings and
a description of the type of roots to which they are added, see the
entries: pa-1,2; paN-1a,c, panggi-, hi-/ha-; hiN-1; -ay/-anay; paka-2,
doubling or Culu-; -in-1, -in2, ka-an2, -in-an1, -in-an2, ma-2.

The inflectional affixes which may be added to a given verb base in a
given meaning are indicated by means of a formula which is explained in
the following subsections. The derivational affixes paN-1a,c, pakig-,
and ka- are also indicated with these formulas.

Our classification of verbs consists of two parts separated by a
semicolon: the active and the passive. The active classes are indicated
by capital letters A, B, C and numbers indicating subclasses; and the
passive classes are indicated by minuscules a, b, and c followed by
numbers indicating subclasses. E.g. palit ‘buy’, which is in class
A; a, takes the active affixes listed for A (Section 7.11) and the
passive affixes listed for a (Section 7.21). In the following
subsections the verbs mentioned as examples of each conjugation class
are listed with examples for all the relevant affixations.



7.1 Active verb classes

7.11 Class A conjugation, the action verbs

Verbs of class A refer to an action. If they are the predicate of the
sentence, the subject is the agent of the action. If they are in
attribute construction, the head is the agent of the action. They occur
with mu-, meanings 1 and 2 [25] (and thus also with mi-, ni-, etc.),
mag-, meanings 1 and 2 (and thus also with nag-, naga-, maga-, etc.),
maka- in all meanings (and thus also with naka-, ka-, etc.). (See the
entries under these affixes for further illustration and explanation.)
The entry for palit ‘buy’ illustrates this class; the entry for
bisiklíta ‘bicycle’ indicates this class with verbs derived from
noun roots, and the entry for hapit,2 ‘drop in s.w.’ illustrates
this class referring to verbs of motion.



7.111 Subclasses of the class A conjugation

The numbers which follow the letter A indicate nonoccurrence of
affixes. The symbol A1 indicates verbs of the A conjugation which do
not occur with the punctual-active set, mu- (mi-, etc.). An example of
a verb of this type is ikspidisiyun ‘go on an expedition’. The
symbol A2 indicates that the base does not occur with the
durative-active set, mag- (nag-, etc.). A verb of this class is sángit
‘catch, snag s.t.’. The symbol A3 indicates that the base does not
occur with the potential-active set, maka- (naka-, etc.), e.g. habhab,3
‘eat away a portion of s.t.’. Two numbers following the letter A
indicate the absence of two of the three active affixes. E.g. A12
indicates a base which occurs only with maka- (naka-, etc.) but not
with mu- and mag-, e.g. salà.

The symbol A13 indicates lack of mu- and maka- but occurrence of mag-,
e.g. dahum ‘expect’.

The symbol S following a number indicates that the base occurs with the
prefix represented, but that there is shift (Section 5.11). E.g.
dalágan ‘run’ is in class A2S: it occurs with all three sets, but
the penult is short when the durative affixes, mag-, etc., are added.
Dáwat ‘receive’ is in class A3S: it occurs with all three active
sets, but the penult is short when the potential affixes, maka-, etc.,
are added.

The symbol P following the letter A indicates that the unaffixed root
and the root plus pa- have exactly the same meaning and are used
interchangeably with the active affixes: e.g. mala ‘dry’.

The symbol A3P indicates that the root occurs with both maka- (naka-)
and, alternatively, with makapa- (nakapa-) with no difference in
meaning. Further, the base occurs with nonpotential affixes, but with
the nonpotential active affixes, pa- cannot be added to the base
without changing the meaning. The symbol A123P means that the root
occurs only with potential-active affixes (i.e., does not occur with
mu- or mag-), but it does occur with maka- and also with makapa- having
the same meaning as maka-, e.g. malarya ‘get malaria’.

The symbol N following A or A plus the numbers indicates that the
prefix paN- can be added to the base together with the punctual-active
affix, mu-, and with the potential-active affix maka- (naka-) but not
with the durative affixes, and that the root alone is synonymous with
the base plus paN-. That is to say, the form mu- (mi-)[root] and maN-
(naN-)[root] [26] are synonymous, and maka- (naka-)[root] is synonymous
with nakapaN-[root] and makapaN-[root]. An example of a root of the AN
conjugation is sanghid ‘ask permission’.



7.12  Class B conjugation, the stative verbs

Verbs of class B refer to s.t. that happened to s.o. or s.t. If they
are the predicate of the sentence, the subject is the thing to which
the event happened. Verbs of class B occur with mu- (mi-, etc.),
meaning 3, mag- (nag-, etc.), meaning 3, ma- (na-, etc.), meaning 3,
maka- (naka-, etc.) or, alternatively, makapa- (nakapa-) with a meaning
‘cause s.t. to become [so-and-so]’, and with magka-2 (nagka-,
etc.). The entry for pula ‘red’ illustrates this conjugation. The
entry for duktur ‘doctor’ illustrates a verb of this class formed
from a noun root.



7.121 Subclasses of verbs of the B conjugation

Verbs of class B1 lack mu-, e.g. págud ‘get burnt’. Verbs of class
B2 lack mag-, e.g. palanas ‘be eroded’. Verbs of B3 occur with
maka- but have a meaning ‘become [so-and-so]’, e.g. laun ‘age’.
Verbs of class B3(1) occur with maka- in two meanings: (1) become
[so-and-so], and (2) cause to become [so-and-so]. In the latter meaning
it also occurs with makapa- (nakapa-), e.g. lup-ut2 ‘thicken’.
Verbs of class B4 lack na- (ma-). E.g. laúsag ‘got worse and
worse’. Verbs of class B5 lack maka- (naka-) and verbs of class B6
lack magka-2, e.g. paliyar ‘for an engine to malfunction’. Many
verbs in the class B conjugation have one or more of these
conjugational features. E.g. duktur as a verb ‘become a doctor’ is
in class B16,—i.e. it lacks mu- and lacks magka-.

The symbols S and N are used just as with the verbs of the A
conjugation. The symbolization B2S indicates that the penult is short
with the durative affixes (mag-, etc.), e.g. lúya ‘get weak’. A
symbol BN indicates that paN- may be added to the base with the
volitional affix (mu-) and that the root plus mu- (mi-, etc.) does not
differ in meaning from the root plus maN- (naN-).1 An example of a verb
of conjugation BN is pula.



7.13 Class C conjugation, the mutual action verbs

Verbs of class C refer to an action which two or more agents engage in
mutually. Verbs in this class usually have a long penult and shift the
stress to the penult if the final syllable of the unaffixed root is
stressed. Verbs of this class occur with the durative prefixes, mag-1,
(nag-, etc.), meaning 5, with the potential prefix magka-1 (nagka-),
and with the prefix makig- (nakig-). The entry for sábut ‘come to an
understanding’ (under sabut (←)) illustrates a verb of class C
conjugation.



7.131  Subclasses of the class C conjugation

The symbol C1 refers to verbs which lack the durative set, mag-. The
symbol C2 refers to verbs which lack the potential set, magka-. The
symbol C3 refers to verbs which lack the set makig-. The listing for
balíus ‘miss each other’ exemplifies a verb of class C13 (missing
both mag-1 and makig-). The entry púyù ‘live together’
illustrates a verb of class C2 (lacking the potential form magka-1).



7.2 Passive verb classes

7.21  Class a verbs

Verbs of class a occur with direct passive affixes (see the entry for
-un1), and the direct passive verb refers to a FOCUS [27] which is the
recipient of the action (see -un1, meaning 1). Verbs of class a
normally also occur with the local passive affixes (see -an1) referring
to a focus which is the place or beneficiary of the action (-an1,
meaning 1). They also occur with the instrumental passive affixes (see
i-1) in the instrumental, beneficial, and temporal meanings (i-1,
meanings 2, 3, and 4). Palit ‘buy’ illustrates a verb of class a.
Hapit ‘drop in’ and dalágan ‘run’ illustrate verbs of class a
that refer to motion. Ábut (under ábut) ‘meet with each other’
illustrates a verb of class a conjugation referring to mutual action.
Dakù illustrates an adjective with class a conjugation. Bisiklíta and
duktur illustrate two different kinds of nouns with class a
conjugation.



7.211 Subclasses of the class a conjugation

Verbs in class a1 lack a local passive; verbs in class a2 lack an
instrumental passive (except in the benefactive and temporal meanings
[-i1, meanings 3 and 4], to which all verbs in the language are
subject). Verbs in class a12 lack both the local and the instrumental
passive. The verb daug, 1 ‘overcome’ exemplifies this conjugation.
Verbs in class a3 have only potential passive affixes, e.g. dungug, 1
‘hear’. Verbs in class a4 refer to a focus which is the thing
suffering from or affected by the thing referred to by the verb (-un1,
meaning 2), e.g. malarya ‘get malaria’.



7.22 Class b verbs

Verbs of class b occur with a local passive affix, and the local
passive refers to a focus which is the recipient of the action (see
-an1, meaning 2). Verbs of this class also normally occur with the
instrumental passive affixes (see i-1) in the instrumental, beneficial,
and temporal meanings (i-1, meanings 2, 3, and 4). Haluk ‘kiss’
illustrates a verb of class b conjugation.



7.221  Subclasses of class b

The symbol b(1) indicates verbs of class b which lack the instrumental
passive conjugation (in any but the benefactive and temporal meanings
[i-1, meanings 3 and 4], to which all verbs in Cebuano are subject). An
example of a b(1) verb is bantay ‘watch’.

The symbol b1 indicates verbs the local passives of which refer to a
focus which is the place of the action (-an1, meaning 1) or, in another
meaning, to the recipient of the action (-an1, in meaning 2). Laba
‘wash’ illustrates a verb of this type.

The symbol b2 indicates verbs of the a conjugation, the local passive
of which refers to the place of the action, but which also occur with
the affix hi-an(→) (hi-i), meaning 2, to refer to the accidental
recipient of the action. Bása ‘read’ illustrates a verb in class
ab2.

The symbol b3 indicates verbs the local passive of which refers to the
reason for the action (-an1, meaning 5). Dalágan ‘run’ illustrates
this class. The symbol b3(1) indicates verbs of class b3 which occur
only with potential affixes (ma-/na-an/-i or, alternatively,
gika-/ka-an/-i). Hadluk ‘be afraid’ illustrates a verb of b3(1).

The symbol b4 indicates verbs the local passive of which refers to a
focus which is the thing affected by the action or the thing this verb
refers to (-an1, meaning 4). Buntag, 3 ‘be overtaken by morning’
illustrates a verb of this class. The symbol b4(1) indicates verbs of
class b4 which have only potential affixes. Walà ‘lose’
illustrates a verb of this class.

The symbol b5 refers to verbs the local passive and the direct passive
of which are synonymous, i.e. occur with -un1, in meaning 1, and -an1,
in meaning 2, where there is no difference between the two sets of
affixation. [28] Abli,2 ‘open’ illustrates a verb of this class.

The symbol b6 refers to verbs which have no passive other than the
local passive and the instrumental passive in the benefactive or
temporal meanings (-i1, meanings 3 and 4), and, further, the local
passive refers to a focus which is the place or the beneficiary of the
action (-an1, meaning 1), or, in the case of adjectives, refers to a
focus which is the person who considered s.o. to be [adjective].
Kulumbítay ‘hang’ is an example of a verb of class b6. The symbol
b6(1) refers to verbs of this sort which also occur with an
instrumental passive in the instrumental meaning—i.e. the focus of
the instrumental passive is the instrument with which the action of the
verb is carried out (i-1, meaning 2). Dagkut, 1 ‘light’ is an
example of a verb of class b6(1).

The symbol b7 indicates verbs the local passive of which refers to a
focus which is s.t. diminished or added to (-an1, meaning 2a). Kúhà
‘take’ illustrates a verb of this conjugation.

The symbol b8 indicates verbs which have only potential local passives.
Kamau ‘know’ (listed under mau) is a verb of class b8.



7.23 Class c verbs

Verbs of class c have instrumental passive affixes which refer to a
focus which is the thing conveyed by the action or the direct recipient
of the action (see i-1, meaning 1). Verbs of class c normally also
occur with the local passive affixes (-an1) referring to a focus which
is the place or the beneficiary of the action (-an1, meaning 1). Lábay
‘throw away’ illustrates a verb of this type. Dalágan,1
illustrates a verb of class c which refers to motion.



7.231 Subclasses of class c verbs

The symbol c1 indicates verbs for which the direct and the instrumental
passive are synonymous (i.e. occur with -un1 in meaning 1 and with i-1
in meaning 1; and the meaning of the form composed of i- plus the base
is synonymous with -un plus the base). [29] Most verbs derived from
adjectives are in class c1.

The symbol c2 indicates verbs for which the local and the instrumental
passive forms are synonymous, where with the local passive and the
instrumental passive forms refer to a focus which is the recipient of
the action (-an1, meaning 2, and i-1, meaning 1). An example of a verb
in class c2 is dusù ‘shove’.

The symbol c3 indicates verbs the instrumental passive of which refers
to a focus which is the recipient of the action (i-, meaning 2), but
which occur only with the potential affixes ika-, gika-. A verb in
class c3 is isturya ‘talk to’.

The symbol c4 refers to verbs which optionally take a prefix ig-1 for
the future instrumental passive nonpotential form and igka-1 for the
future instrumental passive potential form. Dúngug,3 (listed under
dungug (←)) ‘hear from’ is an example of a verb in class c4.

The symbol c5 refers to verbs the instrumental passive of which refers
to a focus which is the reason on account of which the agent came into
[such-and-such] a state (-i, meaning 5, and ika-1, meaning 2). Lípay
‘be happy’ is an example of a verb with c5 conjugation.

The symbol c6 refers to verbs of class c which do not occur with local
passive affixes.





NOTES


[1] We arrive at this figure by totalling the population of towns and
villages in Cebuano-speaking areas in the Census of 1960 (about seven
and a half million). There are no accurate figures as to language
affiliation for the population in the Philippines.

[2] Use of English and to some extent, Spanish, has the function of
distinguishing the upper classes from the ordinary folks, rather than
class dialect.

[3] Thus, for example, in our definition of danggit (a name given to a
small fish) we define as follows: 1 name given to small species of
Teuthis with dots. 2 by extension, name given to any small specimen or
any species of Teuthis. This definition reflects the usage of fishermen
who call any small dotted species of Teuthis, genuine danggit (danggit
nga pyúr), but any species of Teuthis with no dots are called aberrant
forms of the danggit—other related fish are called danggit sa
hunásan ‘the danggit of the tidal flats’ or danggit nga ngisingisi
‘the danggit like the ngisingisi fish’, etc.) Further, by fishermen
these other species of Teuthis are given their own names: danghili and
lilu kan; but among housewives and in the market all these fish are
called danggit.

[4] Just as in an English dictionary we must indicate that the term
‘vagina’ is appropriate to a family-planning lecture, whereas,
‘cunt’ is not, so in Cebuano we must indicate that the term
kinatáwu sa babáyi ‘female genitalia’ is fine for a family
planning lecture but bilat ‘cunt’ is not. We do this by
characterizing kinatáwu sa babáyi as a euphemism and characterizing
bilat as coarse. We do not wish to say that one of these alternative
forms is better than the other, nor do we mean to say that ‘coarse’
forms in Cebuano are taboo. (They are not taboo in the same way that
the English four-letter words are, even though for formal occasions
they are avoided.)

[5] Aside from a few catechisms and novenas, there are practically no
specimens of Cebuano extant which antedate this century, and even
prewar literary productions are extremely difficult to come by. Aside
from the forms marked ‘Biblical’, everything here listed is
contemporary speech.

[6] Approximately five percent of our data is not included for lack of
reliable informants. These are mainly forms of only local currency, a
large portion of them from Bohol.

[7] In the Cebuano of Cebu City and most Cebuano-speaking areas, the
mid-central vowel falls together with /u/. Nice as it would have been
to include information on which forms with /u/ are with a mid-central
vowel dialectally, such information is extremely difficult to come by,
and so we reluctantly had to leave this information to be supplied in
future editions.

[8] The glottal stop in post-consonantal position is usually indicated
in Cebuano publications by a hyphen (as we do): tan-aw /tánʔaw/
‘see’, spelled tan-aw (but sometimes also as tanaw). Between vowels
a glottal stop is occasionally indicated, again with a hyphen: maáyu
/maʔáyu/ ‘good’, spelled maayu, maayo, ma-ayo, or ma-ayu.

[9] In initial position there is no contrast between /ʔ/ and its
absence, and phonetically the [ʔ] is always articulated.
Intervocalically there is no contrast between successive like vowels
and like vowels separated by a /ʔ/ (between [aa] and [aʔa]; [uu] and
[uʔu]; [ii] and [iʔi]), and phonetically the [ʔ] is always present.
Between unlike vowels there is either a [ʔ] or a [w] or [y] glide.

[10] [ts] does not contrast with [c]. Morphologically, when a suffix -s
is added to a base which ends in /t/ the combination ts automatically
becomes [c]: Rit ‘name’ plus -s ‘diminutive suffix’ = Rits
[ric].

[11] A sequence [ds] or [dy] does not occur in final position. When a
suffix -s is added to a base ending with d the combination ds
automatically becomes [j]: Pid ‘name’ plus -s ‘diminutive
suffix’ = Pids [pij].

[12] Our transcription of diy for /dy/ is unequivocal, as I have come
across no case where [diy] occurs in contrast to [dy].

[13] The exception to this rule is forms which contain dead
affixes—affixes which are not part of the productive or even live
Cebuano morphological (inflectional and derivational) systems. Examples
are takílid ‘turn the back’, bakilid ‘slope’, which obviously
have prefixes ta- and ba- respectively and are connected with the root
kílid ‘side’. But since ba- and ta- are not part of the active
Cebuano derivational system, we list them under takílid and bakilid
(with a cross reference to the root kílid). Such forms behave like
roots, and it would only complicate the task of the user if they were
not to be listed with their dead affix.

[14] One difference which sets off roots that are basically verbs from
roots that are basically nouns and adjectives is that verb roots may
occur unaffixed with the meaning ‘action of [doing so-and-so]’
whereas nouns and adjectives may not: Thus, lakaw ‘walk’, túyuk
‘turn’ are verbs because they occur unaffixed as nouns meaning the
action of walking, turning: káda lakaw níya, ‘each time he
walked’; káda túyuk níya, ‘each time he turned around’; but
karsúnis ‘trousers’, ayruplánu ‘airplane’ are not because
they do not occur in this meaning. (To express ‘action of wearing
trousers’ the prefix pag- must be added to the noun karsúnis:
Gidilì ang pagkarsúnis dinhi, ‘It is forbidden to wear pants
here.’ Similarly a pag- must be added to ayruplánu to make a noun
meaning ‘action of ...’: Ang pag-ayruplánu makapadali sa byáhi,
‘Taking a plane hastens the trip.’

Roots that are basically adjectives are distinguished from noun roots
in that they occur with a prefix ka- in exclamations to mean ‘how
very [adjective]!’ whereas nouns do not. Thus buguy ‘tramp’ is an
adjective because it occurs with ka- in this meaning: kabuguy níya
‘what a tramp he is’, whereas kutsi ‘car’ is not. (To express,
‘what a car!’ the suffix -a(←) is used, not ka-: Ngilngígang
kutsíha uy! ‘My! What a car!’)

[15] The root is taken to be inum because the form containing mu- is
muinum ‘will drink’.

[16] However, this is true only of the Cebu City dialect. Other
dialects retain /ʔC/: kàna /káʔna/ ‘eat it’.

[17] Dialectally they change to /d/: hadkan, padngan.

[18] In the strictest sense, of course, no two forms are the same in
meaning: in English, for example, rather pronounced to rhyme with
father is different in meaning from rather pronounced [ræd̵ər]. One
is a strange or affected word and the other is a normal word. But which
form is normal is all a matter of what part of the country one comes
from, and a dictionary which is not regionally biased must list them as
synonymous. Similarly, in Cebuano for any given speaker, where several
forms compete, usually only one form is normal; but, as in the case of
the two rather’s in English, the two competing forms are most often
synonymous from the dictionary’s point of view.

[19] The existence of forms similar in meaning with initial l and
initial vowel, e.g. lárag—árag ‘for leaves to fall off’, shows
that this sound change also crossed morphological boundaries when it
was in effect.

[20] Thus, for example: salámat ‘thanks’ is everywhere with /l/
and a notation to this effect is made in the listing of salámat. But
for balay ‘house’, for example, we make no entry for báy because
from the listing of balay with no further comment alone the reader may
deduce a form báy.

[21] There are also forms with dy (/j/) which do not come from an older
/y/, e.g. pangadyi ‘pray’.

[22] The occurrence of the tense affixation is predictable: a verb form
which occurs with a given voice-mode affix in one tense occurs also in
the same voice and mode in the other tenses. The voice, mode, and
aspect affixes, however, are not predictable. Some verbs occur in one,
some in two, some in three, some in all four voices; some occur only in
the potential mode, some with only durative active affixes, and so
forth.

[23] These affixes are the future forms shown in the chart of this
section. The entries define the voice and mode differences
exhaustively. The difference in tense meanings (between future, past,
and subjunctive) are described in this note. The forms designated
FUTURE refer to future time (as the name suggests):

    Palitun ku ang isdà, I will buy the fish.
    Akuy mupalit ug isdà, I will buy some fish.
    Kinahanglang palitun nímu, You must buy it.

They also may refer to habitual actions and general statements.

    Maáyu siyang mulútug kík, He bakes cakes well.
    Mupalit kug isdà káda adlaw, I buy fish every day.
    Mupula ug lutúun, If you cook it, it will turn red or When you
    cook it, it turns red.

They may also refer to exhortations:

    Palitun ta! Let’s buy it!
    Mupalit tag isdà, Let’s buy some fish.

The forms designated PAST refer to past actions.

    Gipalit ku ang isdà, I bought the fish.
    Nakatilaw na kug isdà, I have already tasted fish.
    Sa nagpalit kug isdà, As I was buying fish.

They also refer to actions still going on.

    Naghilak ang bátà, The child is crying.
    Naglútù pa siya sa isdà, He is still cooking the fish.

The forms designated as SUBJUNCTIVE occur in a phrase and following a
form which itself indicates time: e.g. kagahápun ‘yesterday’,
walà ‘not (past)’, anus-a ‘when (future)’, sa miáging
Duminggu ‘last Sunday’, adtu ‘there (future)’, túa ‘there
(present)’, and the like.

    Ugmà níya palita, He will buy it tomorrow.
    Anus-a nímu palita ang isdà? When will you buy the fish?
    Didtu níya palita, He bought it there.
    Sunud Duminggu níya palita, He will buy it next Sunday.
    Walà níya palita, He did not buy it.

The passive subjunctive forms are also used as imperative forms:

    Palita ang isdà! Buy the fish!
    Ayaw lutúa, Don’t cook it.
    Limpiyúhi ninyu! You (plural) clean it.

Further examples of the tense differences can be found in the
definitions of the future case-mode affixes listed as entries in the
dictionary. The listing under untà, 2a illustrates the use of the
future and past in the apodosis of conditions contrary to fact.

[24] The phonemic value of the morphophonemic symbol N is given in the
following chart:


    For roots beginning with         N plus the initial
                                     consonant after root produces

    p, b                             m
    t, d, s                          n
    k, ʔ (written as initial vowel),
        ng                           ng
    l                                ngl or, alternatively, nl
    other consonants or clusters
    of consonants                    ng plus initial consonant


Examples: palit + paN- = pamalit ‘buy’; baligyà + paN- =
pamaligyà ‘sell’; tindug + paN- = panindug ‘stand’; dala +
paN- = panala ‘bring’; sulud + paN- = panulud ‘enter’; kúhà +
paN- = pangúhà ‘take’; ábang + paN- = pangábang ‘rent’;
ngisi + paN- = pangisi ‘be intent on’; lútù + paN- = panglútù,
panlútù ‘cook’; hisus + paN- = panghisus ‘exclaim Jesus!’.

[25] See the entry for mu-.

[26] maN- is analyzed morphophonemically as mu- plus paN-, and naN- as
mi- plus paN-. See Section 6.2.

[27] The term FOCUS is given to the word to which the verb refers. If
the verb is the head of the predicate of the sentence, the FOCUS is the
subject (in bold face in the following examples):

Gipalit níya ang pán, He bought the bread.

If the verb is the subject of the sentence, the FOCUS is the predicate:

Pán ang íyang gipalit, It was bread that he bought.

If the verb modifies a noun (is attribute to a noun), the noun is the
FOCUS:

Ang pán nga íyang gipalit, The bread he bought.

[28] In cases of bases which occur with direct passive affixes in the
direct meaning (-un1, 1) and with local passives in the direct meaning
(-an1, in meaning 1), but the two are not synonymous, the verb is
classed ab.

[29] If a base occurs with the direct and the instrumental passive,
where i- has the meaning 1, but the direct and instrumental passive
forms are not synonymous, the verb is said to be in class ac, e.g.
lábay ‘throw’. Dalágan ‘run’ is an example of a verb
referring to motion in the ac conjugation.
