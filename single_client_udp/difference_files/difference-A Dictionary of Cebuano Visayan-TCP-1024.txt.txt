> Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
> spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
> increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
> freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
> array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations

> status with the IRS.
> 
> The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
> charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
> States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
> considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
> with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
> where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
> SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
> particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

> While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
> have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
> against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
> approach us with offers to donate.
> 
> International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
> any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
> outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

> works.
> 
> Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
> concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
> with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
> Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
> 
> Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
> editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
> unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
> keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
> 
> Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

>      www.gutenberg.org
> 
> This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
> including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
> Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
> subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
