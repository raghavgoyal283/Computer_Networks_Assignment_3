THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY SOUTHEAST ASIA PROGRAM


The Southeast Asia Program was organized at Cornell University in the
Department of Far Eastern Studies in 1950. It is a teaching and
research program of interdisciplinary studies in the humanities, social
sciences, and some natural sciences. It deals with Southeast Asia as a
region, and with the individual countries of the area: Brunei, Burma,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.

The activities of the Program are carried on both at Cornell and in
Southeast Asia. They include an undergraduate and graduate curriculum
at Cornell which provides instruction by specialists in Southeast Asian
cultural history and present-day affairs and offers intensive training
in each of the major languages of the area. The Program sponsors group
research projects on Thailand, on Indonesia, on the Philippines, and on
the area’s Chinese minorities. At the same time, individual staff and
students of the Program have done field research in every Southeast
Asian country.

A list of publications relating to Southeast Asia which may be obtained
on prepaid order directly from the Program is given at the end of this
volume. Information on Program staff, fellowships, requirements for
degrees, and current course offerings will be found in an Announcement
of the Department of Asian Studies, obtainable from the Director,
Southeast Asia Program, 120 Uris Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, New
York 14850.

PREFACE


This work is a dictionary of Cebuano Visayan, the language of the
central part of the Philippines and much of Mindanao. Although the
explanations are given in English, the aim of this work is not to
provide English equivalents but to explain Cebuano forms in terms of
themselves. It is meant as a reference work for Cebuano speakers and as
a tool for students of the Cebuano language. There is a total of some
25,000 entries and an addenda of 700 forms which were prepared after
the dictionary had been composed.

This dictionary is the product of eleven years work by more than a
hundred persons. The work was edited by me and is my responsibility,
but the sources are entirely native, and all illustrations are composed
by native speakers. The personnel who wrote up the entries are listed
in Section 2.1, p. ix. The manuscript went through five versions, the
final on an IBM selectric composer. The whole composition was done in
Cebu City in five months’ time by Pacifico Briones, Nicolasito
Catingan, Florecita Florido, Donata Laingo, and Grace Mendoza. The
drafting and splicing were done by Carlito Gubaynon and Felismeno
Simplicio. The proofreading and editing was done by me together with
Mrs. Elizabeth Say, Mrs. Fe Cuenca, Richard Quiñanola, and my wife Ida
Wolff. In the earlier stages of gathering, transcribing, and indexing
materials a huge number of people participated, too numerous to mention
by name. The entire dictionary through the final composed product was
compiled from notes on index cards in the course of twenty-six months.
My thanks go especially to the staff listed above and on p. ix for
their cooperative spirit. Without their willingness to work overtime,
this dictionary could not have been completed.

The work was supported from 1963 to 1966 by funds from Cornell
University faculty research grants; 1966–7 by Office of Education
contract No. 1-7-002672-2040; 1967–1968 by a Cornell University
faculty research grant; 1968–1969 by a grant from the American
Council of Learned Societies and by a grant from the Cornell University
Philippine Project; 1969–1971 by Office of Education Contract No.
0-9-097718-3350. My trip to the Philippines was financed in 1966–1969
and again in 1970–71 by a Fulbright-Hayes faculty research grant.
Without these sources of funds this dictionary could not have been
completed.

This dictionary by no means exhausts the Cebuano language, and we hope
in future years to produce an expanded and improved version with
illustrations. To this end we welcome and would be most grateful for
suggestions for corrections and additions.

FOREWORD


The Southeast Asia Program takes particular pleasure in helping to make
this Cebuano dictionary available. The language is, of course, of
importance in itself, not only because of its wide use in the
Philippines, but also because of its value to linguists and historical
research.

In addition, we are especially pleased that this dictionary is a joint
publication of the Southeast Asia Program and the Linguistic Society of
the Philippines. We owe a special debt of gratitude to the Rev. Teodoro
Llamzon, S. J., president of the Linguistic Society of the Philippines,
for his gracious help and cooperation in attending to the many details
involved in such a cooperative venture. We are also grateful to the
Asia Foundation, which provided a partial subsidy to make publication
possible.

We are confident that Professor Wolff’s research on Cebuano and the
compilation of this work, covering a period of eleven years, has
resulted in a useful reference work and in an important contribution to
our knowledge of Philippine languages and cultures and to linguistics
in general.

v           verb
voc.        vocative
x-          x is a prefix
-x          x is a suffix
-x-         x is infixed after the initial consonant
x1, x2      there are two roots with the shape x, members of different
            morphemes
x-y         x is a prefix, and y is a suffi contrast to [dy].

[13] The exception to this rule is forms which contain dead
affixes—affixes which are not part of the productive or even live
Cebuano morphological (inflectional and derivational) systems. Examples
are takílid ‘turn the back’, bakilid ‘slope’, which obviously
have prefixes ta- and ba- respectively and are connected with the root
kílid ‘side’. But since ba- and ta- are not part of the active
Cebuano derivational system, we list them under takílid and bakilid
(with a cross reference to the root kílid). Such forms behave like
roots, and it would only complicate the task of the user if they were
not to be listed with their dead affix.

[14] One difference which sets off roots that are basically verbs from
roots that are basically nouns and adjectives is that verb roots may
occur unaffixed with the meaning ‘action of [doing so-and-so]’
whereas nouns and adjectives may not: Thus, lakaw ‘walk’, túyuk
‘turn’ are verbs because they occur unaffixed as nouns meaning the
action of walking, turning: káda lakaw níya, ‘each time he
walked’; káda túyuk níya, ‘each time he turned around’; but
karsúnis ‘trousers’, ayruplánu ‘airplane’ are not because
they do not occur in this meaning. (To express ‘action of wearing
trousers’ the prefix pag- must be added to the noun karsúnis:
Gidilì ang pagkarsúnis dinhi, ‘It is forbidden to wear pants
here.’ Similarly a pag- must be added to ayruplánu to make a noun
meaning ‘action of ...’: Ang pag-ayruplánu makapadali sa byáhi,
‘Taking a plane hastens the trip.’

Roots that are basically adjectives are distinguished from noun roots
in that they occur with a prefix ka- in exclamations to mean ‘how
very [adjective]!’ whereas nouns do not. Thus buguy ‘tramp’ is an
adjective because it occurs with ka- in this meaning: kabuguy níya
‘what a tramp he is’, whereas kutsi ‘car’ is not. (To express,
‘what a car!’ the suffix -a(←) is used, not ka-: Ngilngígang
kutsíha uy! ‘My! What a car!’)

[15] The root is taken to be inum because the form containing mu- is
muinum ‘will drink’.

[16] However, this is true only of the Cebu City dialect. Other
dialects retain /ʔC/: kàna /káʔna/ ‘eat it’.

[17] Dialectally they change to /d/: hadkan, padngan.

[18] In the strictest sense, of course, no two forms are the same in
meaning: in English, for example, rather pronounced to rhyme with
father is different in meaning from rather pronounced [ræd̵ər]. One
is a strange or affected word and the other is a normal word. But which
form is normal is all a matter of what part of the country one comes
from, and a dictionary which is not regionally biased must list them as
synonymous. Similarly, in Cebuano for any given speaker, where several
forms compete, usually only one form is normal; but, as in the case of
the two rather’s in English, the two competing forms are most often
synonymous from the dictionary’s point of view.

[19] The existence of forms similar in meaning with initial l and
initial vowel, e.g. lárag—árag ‘for leaves to fall off’, shows
that this sound change also crossed morphological boundaries when it
was in effect.

[20] Thus, for example: salámat ‘thanks’ is everywhere with /l/
and a notation to this effect is made in the listing of salámat. But
for balay ‘house’, for example, we make no entry for báy because
from the listing of balay with no further comment alone the reader may
deduce a form báy.

[21] There are also forms with dy (/j/) which do not come from an older
/y/, e.g. pangadyi ‘pray’.

[22] The occurrence of the tense affixation is predictable: a verb form
which occurs with a given voice-mode affix in one tense occurs also in
the same voice and mode in the other tenses. The voice, mode, and
aspect affixes, however, are not predictable. Some verbs occur in one,
some in two, some in three, some in all four voices; some occur only in
the potential mode, some with only durative active affixes, and so
forth.

[23] These affixes are the future forms shown in the chart of this
section. The entries define the voice and mode differences
exhaustively. The difference in tense meanings (between future, past,
and subjunctive) are described in this note. The forms designated
FUTURE refer to future time (as the name suggests):

    Palitun ku ang isdà, I will buy the fish.
    Akuy mupalit ug isdà, I will buy some fish.
    Kinahanglang palitun nímu, You must buy it.

They also may refer to habitual actions and general statements.

    Maáyu siyang mulútug kík, He bakes cakes well.
    Mupalit kug isdà káda adlaw, I buy fish every day.
    Mupula ug lutúun, If you cook it, it will turn red or When you
    cook it, it turns red.

They may also refer to exhortations:

    Palitun ta! Let’s buy it!
    Mupalit tag isdà, Let’s buy some fish.

The forms designated PAST refer to past actions.

    Gipalit ku ang isdà, I bought the fish.
    Nakatilaw na kug isdà, I have already tasted fish.
    Sa nagpalit kug isdà, As I was buying fish.

They also refer to actions still going on.

    Naghilak ang bátà, The child is crying.
    Naglútù pa siya sa isdà, He is still cooking the fish.

The forms designated as SUBJUNCTIVE occur in a phrase and following a
form which itself indicates time: e.g. kagahápun ‘yesterday’,
walà ‘not (past)’, anus-a ‘when (future)’, sa miáging
Duminggu ‘last Sunday’, adtu ‘there (future)’, túa ‘there
(present)’, and the like.

    Ugmà níya palita, He will buy it tomorrow.
    Anus-a nímu palita ang isdà? When will you buy the fish?
    Didtu níya palita, He bought it there.
    Sunud Duminggu níya palita, He will buy it next Sunday.
    Walà níya palita, He did not buy it.

The passive subjunctive forms are also used as imperative forms:

    Palita ang isdà! Buy the fish!
    Ayaw lutúa, Don’t cook it.
    Limpiyúhi ninyu! You (plural) clean it.

Further examples of the tense differences can be found in the
definitions of the future case-mode affixes listed as entries in the
dictionary. The listing under untà, 2a illustrates the use of the
future and past in the apodosis of conditions contrary to fact.

[24] The phonemic value of the morphophonemic symbol N is given in the
following chart:


    For roots beginning with         N plus the initial
                                     consonant after root produces

    p, b                             m
    t, d, s                          n
    k, ʔ (written as initial vowel),
        ng                           ng
    l                                ngl or, alternatively, nl
    other consonants or clusters
    of consonants                    ng plus initial consonant


Examples: palit + paN- = pamalit ‘buy’; baligyà + paN- =
pamaligyà ‘sell’; tindug + paN- = panindug ‘stand’; dala +
paN- = panala ‘bring’; sulud + paN- = panulud ‘enter’; kúhà +
paN- = pangúhà ‘take’; ábang + paN- = pangábang ‘rent’;
ngisi + paN- = pangisi ‘be intent on’; lútù + paN- = panglútù,
panlútù ‘cook’; hisus + paN- = panghisus ‘exclaim Jesus!’.

[25] See the entry for mu-.

[26] maN- is analyzed morphophonemically as mu- plus paN-, and naN- as
mi- plus paN-. See Section 6.2.

[27] The term FOCUS is given to the word to which the verb refers. If
the verb is the head of the predicate of the sentence, the FOCUS is the
subject (in bold face in the following examples):

Gipalit níya ang pán, He bought the bread.

If the verb is the subject of the sentence, the FOCUS is the predicate:

Pán ang íyang gipalit, It was bread that he bought.

If the verb modifies a noun (is attribute to a noun), the noun is the
FOCUS:

Ang pán nga íyang gipalit, The bread he bought.

[28] In cases of bases which occur with direct passive affixes in the
direct meaning (-un1, 1) and with local passives in the direct meaning
(-an1, in meaning 1), but the two are not synonymous, the verb is
classed ab.

[29] If a base occurs with the direct and the instrumental passive,
where i- has the meaning 1, but the direct and instrumental passive
forms are not synonymous, the verb is said to be in class ac, e.g.
lábay ‘throw’. Dalágan ‘run’ is an example of a verb
referring to motion in the ac conjugation.
