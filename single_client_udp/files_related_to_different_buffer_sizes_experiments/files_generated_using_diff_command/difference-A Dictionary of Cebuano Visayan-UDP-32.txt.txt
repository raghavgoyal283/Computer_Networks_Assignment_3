> 1.0 Cebuano
> 
> 
> This work is a dictionary of Cebuano Visayan, here called Cebuano for
> short. Cebuano is spoken in the central portions of the Philippines: on
> the islands of Cebu and Bohol, on the eastern half of Negros, western
> half of Leyte, along the northern coasts of Mindanao, and on smaller
> islands in the vicinity of these areas. A large portion of the urban
> population of Zamboanga, Davao, and Cotabato is Cebuano speaking.
> Cebuano is also widely spoken throughout the lowland areas of the
> entire eastern third of Mindanao, where it is spreading at the expense
> of the native languages (most of which are closely related to Cebuano).
> Cebuano is the trade language in most places in Mindanao where
> Cebuano-speaking populations and populations speaking other languages
> are in contact.
> 
> Cebuano is also called Sugbuanon and is one of more than a dozen
> languages or dialects which are given the name Bisayan or Visayan.
> Other types of Visayan are spoken in areas surrounding the
> Cebuano-speaking area on the north, east, west, and southeast. This
> dictionary is confined to Cebuano forms and does not include forms
> which are not Cebuano from other languages called Visayan spoken
> outside of the area we have delineated.
> 
> In the areas where Cebuano is native and, to a large extent, also in
> areas where Cebuano is a trade language, it is used for almost every
> aspect of daily life and for most formal occasions: radio-TV, social
> life, religious life, business, and the first two grades of school.
> Cebuano is also largely used in the later grades, although English is
> supposed to be the medium of instruction. In these areas Cebuano
> language publications enjoy a wide readership.
> 
> Somewhere between one-quarter and one-third of the population of the
> Philippines speaks Cebuano natively. [1] But despite its numerical
> importance and wide use Cebuano lags far behind Tagalog (Pilipino) in
> prestige and development as a means of literary and scientific
> expression. In the schools the emphasis is almost entirely English:
> Cebuano composition is not a school subject, and students read nothing
> in Cebuano after the first two grades. In prestige Cebuano is losing
> ground: for the upper and middle class elite, with isolated
> praiseworthy exceptions, eloquence in Cebuano is not admired. In fact
> it is almost a matter of pride not to know Cebuano well. Thus, despite
> a phenomenal increase in literacy and in the total number of potential
> contributors and participants in Cebuano literature, output has
> declined in quantity and quality at an ever increasing rate over the
> past two generations. The cultivation and development of Cebuano is
> left to the least influential segments of the population, to whom
> English education and exposure to English publications are minimally
> available. These people still compose the vast majority of the
> population, but the influential classes that have grown up knowing only
> a dilute and inarticulate Cebuano are ever increasing in number,
> proportion, and prestige.
>

> 
> 1.1 Dialects
> 
> The Cebuano language is remarkably uniform. There are differences, to
> be sure, but these differences are no greater than the differences
> found among the various varieties of English spoken around the world.
> There are scattered places within the Cebuano area which use a speech
> widely aberrant from what we describe here: Surigao, Bantayan Islands,
> and the Camotes Islands. Forms peculiar to those areas we have simply
> omitted except for a few widely used forms which tend to find their way
> into standard Cebuano as spoken by natives of these areas. Such forms
> are listed, but marked ‘dialectal’. Otherwise whatever forms we
> have found we have listed without comment, whether or not they are in
> current use throughout the Cebuano speech area.
> 
> 
> 
> 1.12 Correct and incorrect speech
> 
> A happy consequence of the low regard which Cebuano speakers have of
> their own language is that the doctrine of correctness has never gained
> foothold. Dialectal differences are purely local, not social, [2] and
> speakers regard whatever forms they are familiar with as correct. We
> have followed the same principle in this dictionary: no attempt is made
> to prescribe which forms or usages are appropriate, but rather we try
> to show which forms and usages occur. The various meanings of a given
> form are listed in such a way that their relation is readily
> discernible: meanings which are derived by extension or specialization
> from an original meaning are listed under subheadings of the
> original-meaning. [3]
> 
> Occasionally annotations such as ‘slang’, ‘euphemism’,
> ‘humorous’, ‘coarse’, and the like, are given. These
> annotations signal only that Cebuano speakers tend to regard these
> forms as such and that they occur only in styles of speech appropriate
> to these forms. [4] We use the following terminology: Biblical,
> literary, metaphorical, humorous, euphemism, coarse, colloquial. The
> designation BIBLICAL indicates a form confined to liturgical language
> or the Bible; LITERARY indicates a form confined to high-flown styles,
> not ordinarily spoken; METAPHORICAL indicates a meaning recognized as
> metaphorical in some way (not necessarily confined to literary style);
> HUMOROUS, a meaning commonly given to a form, but not the primary
> meaning, which gives the feeling of an oft-repeated joke; EUPHEMISM, a
> form that is used to avoid saying s.t directly, the meaning of which is
> readily understood but not as jarring as if it had been said directly;
> COARSE, a form that clearly would jar the hearer and that is confined
> to speech used in anger or used as a sign of intimacy or disrespect;
> SLANG indicates a form confined to intimate speech among people of
> similar occupations or life styles; COLLOQUIAL indicates forms avoided
> in formal discourse or writing, but commonly used in normal speech even
> among non-intimates.

> 2.0 Basis of this work
> 
> 
> This dictionary is a comprehensive listing of approximately 25,000
> Cebuano roots with English explanations of their meanings and uses and
> an indication of the affixational system to which each root is subject,
> with ample illustrations. Most of the forms here listed are taken from
> written sources or from taped oral sources of Cebuano of nearly a
> million words, gathered from all over the Cebuano speech area and
> covering a wide range of topics and styles. The written sources are
> some 400 issues of Cebuano publications: Bisaya, Silaw, and Bag-ong
> Suga, a few novenas, novels, and other collections that have been
> published. [5] About ninety percent of the forms here listed come from
> these oral or printed sources. Forms which did not occur in these
> sources but which were well known to me or at least one of the members
> of the staff that composed this dictionary are also included. Further,
> any form which occurred in our sources which was not known to our
> personnel was not included. [6] Although there are numerous published
> sources of Cebuano forms—dictionaries and anthropological and
> biological studies, we have not taken any forms from them that could
> not be confirmed directly from our texts or informants.
> 
> 
> 
> 2.1 Personnel
> 
> The collection, transcription, and classification of the texts was
> carried out by a large staff in Cebu City, originating from all over
> the Cebuano speech area. The final stage, the writing up of the
> definitions, was carried by a small staff, exclusively native speakers
> of Cebuano now resident in Cebu: Miss E. Agapay, of Malitbog, Leyte,
> but also a long time resident of Talibon, Bohol, and in Guihulngan,
> Negros Oriental; Nicolas Ampatin, of Malitbog, Leyte; Abel Angus, of
> Tudela, Camotes; José Dioko, of Malaboyoc, Cebu; Mrs. E. Emnace, of
> Dumanjug, Cebu; Atty. A. Estorco, of Guihulngan, Negros Oriental;
> Everett Mendoza, of Maasin, Leyte; Mrs. D. Ag. Villondo, of Dumanjug,
> Cebu, but also a long time resident of Ozamis City, and Molave,
> Zamboanga del Sur.
> 
> 
> 
> 2.2 Other sources
> 
> The scientific names for plants and shells are based upon specimens
> which were gathered and identified with their Cebuano names by reliable
> informants. The specimens were compared against the available
> literature, and where identification was certain, scientific names were
> given. Our scientific names for plants are taken from the following
> sources (in order—plants not listed in the first were referred to the
> second, those not in the first or second were referred to the third,
> and so forth): Brown, Quisumbing, Merrill, Steiner. For shellfish, we
> give no scientific names but follow the English terminology of Abbott,
> 1962. For the fishes and birds, we relied mainly on pictures for
> Cebuano identification. For fish available in the local markets, we
> could examine actual specimens. The scientific names of fish follow
> those given by Herre (1953) and for birds by Delacour and Myer.
> 
> We made heavy use of the anthropological sources listed in the
> bibliography but independently checked all information incorporated and
> used terminology listed in them only insofar as we could corroborate
> it.

> In addition there is a fourth mid-central vowel which occurs

> Vowels may be long or short. Contrast between long and short vowels
> occurs only in the final and the penultimate syllable of the word:
> káun [kā́ʔun] ‘eat’ and nagdá [nagdā́] ‘is bringing’.
> Further, there is only one long vowel per word. There is also a phoneme

> stress can be determined by the phonological make-up of the word: 1
> stress falls on the long vowel of the word if the word has a long
> vowel: nagdá [nagdā́], káun [kā́ʔun]. 2 for words that have no
> long vowel, stress is on the penultimate if it is closed: tan-aw
> [tánʔaw] ‘see’; mugbù [múgbuʔ] ‘short’. If the penultimate
> is open and short, stress is on the ultimate: mala [malá] ‘dry’.
> Occasionally, in words with a closed penult the final syllable is
> stressed (marked here with a wedge): mandǎr [mandár] ‘order’;

> 5.2 Competing forms
> 
> Because of sound changes which took place over portions of the
> Cebuano-speaking areas but did not spread over the entire area and the
> subsequent spread of forms which reflect these changes, there are
> numerous competing forms which are of the same etymology and which
> usually (but not always) have the same meaning. [18]
> 
> Forms which are the same in meaning and which are related to each other
> in that one underwent the sound change and the other did not are
> defined only once and cross reference is made. Some sound changes are
> so common and regular that only the older form is listed, and it is to
> be taken for granted that the form which shows the sound change also
> normally occurs unless a statement to the contrary is made.

> 5.21   Dropping of /l/
> 
> 5.211   Intervocalic /l/
> 
> Most (but not all) roots which contain an /l/ between /a/’s and
> /u/’s compete with roots which lack /l/. The forms without /l/ are
> used generally in the Northeastern portion of the Cebuano area: all
> areas east of Cebu (Bohol, Masbate, Leyte and islands in between) and
> on the northern half of Cebu. In the Southwestern areas (Negros,
> southern half of Cebu and most of Mindanao, the /l/ forms predominate.
> 
> Between like vowels /l/ is dropped and the vowel is usually lengthened:
> kalabaw or kábaw ‘water buffalo’; balay or báy ‘house’;
> tutulu or tutú ‘three’. In closed syllables or in the case of /l/
> beginning the antepenult, no compensatory lengthening takes place:
> kalatkat or katkat ‘climb’; kalamunggay or kamunggay ‘k.o.
> tree’.
> 
> Between /a/ and /u/ or /u/ and /a/, /l/ becomes /w/: lalum or lawum
> ‘deep’; sulab or suwab ‘blade’. The sequence /alu/ in the
> antepenult and penult or earlier in the root becomes /u/ in Cebu and
> northern Leyte but /awu/ in Bohol and southern Leyte: dalunggan or
> dunggan or dawunggan ‘ear’.
> 
> This alternation is for the most part confined to the root. [19]
> Otherwise, it is so regular that only the forms containing /l/ are
> listed, and the presumption is made that the /l/ may be dropped unless
> a note is made to the contrary. [20]
> 
> 
> 
> 5.212   Post-consonantal /l/
> 
> There is a tendency to drop post-consonantal /l/ usually (but not
> always) with compensatory lengthening of the vowel of the penult:
> kinahanglan or kinahángan ‘need’; aplud or apud ‘astringent in
> taste’; danglug or dángug or dangug ‘slippery’. The /l/-less
> forms are most common in the areas which drop intervocalic /l/. The
> dropping of post-consonantal /l/ is by no means as widespread as
> dropping of intervocalic /l/, and alternative forms are listed.
> 
> 
> 
> 5.213   Final /l/
> 
> In Bohol and southern Leyte there is a tendency for /al/ at the end of
> a word to become /aw/ and /ul/ to become /u/: bagal or bagaw
> ‘shell’. In this case alternative forms are listed.
> 
> 
> 
> 5.214  Change of /l/ to /y/
> 
> Historically, intervocalic /l/ in isolated dialects became /y/. Forms
> with /y/ for /l/ have spread throughout the Cebuano-speaking area, and
> some are in competition with /l/-retaining forms: tingáli or tingáyi
> ‘perhaps’; kalugpus or kayugpus (also kugpus—by the rule of
> 5.211) ‘fold the arms’. In this case, competing forms are listed
> with cross reference.
> 
> 
> 
> 5.22   Assimilation and metathesis
> 
> There is a tendency for nasal consonants which abut on consonants to be
> assimilated: bungdul or bundul ‘poke’; hingbis or himbis
> ‘scales’; amgid or anggid (also ambid) ‘like’. This alternation
> is sporadic, and competing forms are listed.
> 
> There is some competition between forms with voiced and forms with
> voiceless consonants, where the competition derives from assimilation:
> tikbas or tigbas ‘strike with a blade’; bukdu or bugdu ‘bulging
> out’. Again the competing forms are listed.
> 
> There is also competition between forms which differ by virtue of
> metathesis: bungdul or dungbul (and dumbul) ‘poke’; itsa or ista
> ‘throw’; bàgu /baʔgu/ or bag-u /bagʔu/ ‘new’. (Cf. Section
> 5.14.) Competing forms that differ by virtue of metathesis are listed
> except for forms containing a sequence /Cʔ/ which invariably compete
> with forms containing /ʔC/.
> 
> 
> 
> 5.23   Change of vowels
> 
> The vowel of the antepenult sporadically may change to /a/: kumusta or
> kamusta ‘how are, is’; batíis or bitíis ‘leg’. Occasionally
> /a/ or /u/ is assimilated to a following /y/ or an /i/ in the following
> syllable: biyà or bayà ‘leave’; musimus or misimus ‘lowly’.
> In these cases competing forms are listed.
> 
> 
> 
> 5.24  Change of /y/ to /dy/
> 
> In Bohol and Southern Leyte /y/ becomes /j/ (written dy). Some forms
> with dy have spread throughout the Cebuano speech area or occur only in
> the Bohol-Southern Leyte speech. Such forms are listed with dy. [21]
> Other forms with dy are listed as with y, and the reader may conclude
> that these forms have /dy/ in Bohol and Southern Leyte.
>

> 
> 5.25   Competing forms where no sound change is involved

> Roots which are not relatable by the above rules are given separate

> 6.1  Inflection
> 
> Verb forms are subject to the addition of a small list of affixes which
> we call INFLECTIONAL AFFIXES. The inflectional affixes specify three
> tenses: PAST, FUTURE, and SUBJUNCTIVE; four cases or voices: ACTIVE,
> DIRECT PASSIVE, LOCAL PASSIVE, and INSTRUMENTAL PASSIVE; and two modes:
> POTENTIAL and NONPOTENTIAL. The nonpotential forms are further broken
> down into two aspects: PUNCTUAL and DURATIVE. The punctual-durative
> distinction exists in all voices but is observed only in the active
> voice. [22] In the passive voices punctual forms are used for all
> meanings, except for literary or dialectal styles where the
> durative-nondurative distinction is maintained. The following chart
> shows these affixes. Their meanings are listed and exemplified in
> entries in the dictionary listed under mu-, mag-1, maka-1, -un1, ma-1,
> -an1, i-1.  [23] In the following chart commas indicate forms which are

> 
> The symbol b6 refers to verbs which have no passive other than the
> local passive and the instrumental passive in the benefactive or
> temporal meanings (-i1, meanings 3 and 4), and, further, the local
> passive refers to a focus which is the place or the beneficiary of the
> action (-an1, meaning 1), or, in the case of adjectives, refers to a
> focus which is the person who considered s.o. to be [adjective].
> Kulumbítay ‘hang’ is an example of a verb of class b6. The symbol

> 
> Verbs of class c have instrumental passive affixes which refer to a

> of the action (see i-1, meaning 1). Verbs of class c normally also
> occur with the local passive affixes (-an1) referring to a focus which

> 7.231 Subclasses of class c verbs
> 
> The symbol c1 indicates verbs for which the direct and the instrumental
> passive are synonymous (i.e. occur with -un1 in meaning 1 and with i-1
> in meaning 1; and the meaning of the form composed of i- plus the base
> is synonymous with -un plus the base). [29] Most verbs derived from
> adjectives are in class c1.
> 
> The symbol c2 indicates verbs for which the local and the instrumental
> passive forms are synonymous, where with the local passive and the
> instrumental passive forms refer to a focus which is the recipient of
> the action (-an1, meaning 2, and i-1, meaning 1). An example of a verb
> in class c2 is dusù ‘shove’.
> 
> The symbol c3 indicates verbs the instrumental passive of which refers
> to a focus which is the recipient of the action (i-, meaning 2), but
> which occur only with the potential affixes ika-, gika-. A verb in
> class c3 is isturya ‘talk to’.
> 
> The symbol c4 refers to verbs which optionally take a prefix ig-1 for
> the future instrumental passive nonpotential form and igka-1 for the
> future instrumental passive potential form. Dúngug,3 (listed under
> dungug (←)) ‘hear from’ is an example of a verb in class c4.

> The symbol c5 refers to verbs the instrumental passive of which refers

> [1] We arrive at this figure by totalling the population of towns and
> villages in Cebuano-speaking areas in the Census of 1960 (about seven
> and a half million). There are no accurate figures as to language
> affiliation for the population in the Philippines.
> 
> [2] Use of English and to some extent, Spanish, has the function of
> distinguishing the upper classes from the ordinary folks, rather than
> class dialect.
> 
> [3] Thus, for example, in our definition of danggit (a name given to a
> small fish) we define as follows: 1 name given to small species of
> Teuthis with dots. 2 by extension, name given to any small specimen or
> any species of Teuthis. This definition reflects the usage of fishermen
> who call any small dotted species of Teuthis, genuine danggit (danggit
> nga pyúr), but any species of Teuthis with no dots are called aberrant
> forms of the danggit—other related fish are called danggit sa
> hunásan ‘the danggit of the tidal flats’ or danggit nga ngisingisi
> ‘the danggit like the ngisingisi fish’, etc.) Further, by fishermen
> these other species of Teuthis are given their own names: danghili and
> lilu kan; but among housewives and in the market all these fish are
> called danggit.
> 
> [4] Just as in an English dictionary we must indicate that the term
> ‘vagina’ is appropriate to a family-planning lecture, whereas,
> ‘cunt’ is not, so in Cebuano we must indicate that the term
> kinatáwu sa babáyi ‘female genitalia’ is fine for a family
> planning lecture but bilat ‘cunt’ is not. We do this by
> characterizing kinatáwu sa babáyi as a euphemism and characterizing
> bilat as coarse. We do not wish to say that one of these alternative
> forms is better than the other, nor do we mean to say that ‘coarse’
> forms in Cebuano are taboo. (They are not taboo in the same way that
> the English four-letter words are, even though for formal occasions
> they are avoided.)
> 
> [5] Aside from a few catechisms and novenas, there are practically no
> specimens of Cebuano extant which antedate this century, and even
> prewar literary productions are extremely difficult to come by. Aside
> from the forms marked ‘Biblical’, everything here listed is
> contemporary speech.
> 
> [6] Approximately five percent of our data is not included for lack of
> reliable informants. These are mainly forms of only local currency, a
> large portion of them from Bohol.
> 
> [7] In the Cebuano of Cebu City and most Cebuano-speaking areas, the
> mid-central vowel falls together with /u/. Nice as it would have been
> to include information on which forms with /u/ are with a mid-central
> vowel dialectally, such information is extremely difficult to come by,
> and so we reluctantly had to leave this information to be supplied in
> future editions.
> 
> [8] The glottal stop in post-consonantal position is usually indicated
> in Cebuano publications by a hyphen (as we do): tan-aw /tánʔaw/
> ‘see’, spelled tan-aw (but sometimes also as tanaw). Between vowels
> a glottal stop is occasionally indicated, again with a hyphen: maáyu
> /maʔáyu/ ‘good’, spelled maayu, maayo, ma-ayo, or ma-ayu.
> 
> [9] In initial position there is no contrast between /ʔ/ and its
> absence, and phonetically the [ʔ] is always articulated.
> Intervocalically there is no contrast between successive like vowels
> and like vowels separated by a /ʔ/ (between [aa] and [aʔa]; [uu] and
> [uʔu]; [ii] and [iʔi]), and phonetically the [ʔ] is always present.
> Between unlike vowels there is either a [ʔ] or a [w] or [y] glide.
> 
> [10] [ts] does not contrast with [c]. Morphologically, when a suffix -s
> is added to a base which ends in /t/ the combination ts automatically
> becomes [c]: Rit ‘name’ plus -s ‘diminutive suffix’ = Rits
> [ric].
> 
> [11] A sequence [ds] or [dy] does not occur in final position. When a
> suffix -s is added to a base ending with d the combination ds
> automatically becomes [j]: Pid ‘name’ plus -s ‘diminutive
> suffix’ = Pids [pij].
> 
> [12] Our transcription of diy for /dy/ is unequivocal, as I have come
> across no case where [diy] occurs in contrast to [dy].
> 
> [13] The exception to this rule is forms which contain dead
> affixes—affixes which are not part of the productive or even live
> Cebuano morphological (inflectional and derivational) systems. Examples
> are takílid ‘turn the back’, bakilid ‘slope’, which obviously
> have prefixes ta- and ba- respectively and are connected with the root
> kílid ‘side’. But since ba- and ta- are not part of the active
> Cebuano derivational system, we list them under takílid and bakilid
> (with a cross reference to the root kílid). Such forms behave like
> roots, and it would only complicate the task of the user if they were
> not to be listed with their dead affix.
> 
> [14] One difference which sets off roots that are basically verbs from
> roots that are basically nouns and adjectives is that verb roots may
> occur unaffixed with the meaning ‘action of [doing so-and-so]’
> whereas nouns and adjectives may not: Thus, lakaw ‘walk’, túyuk
> ‘turn’ are verbs because they occur unaffixed as nouns meaning the
> action of walking, turning: káda lakaw níya, ‘each time he
> walked’; káda túyuk níya, ‘each time he turned around’; but
> karsúnis ‘trousers’, ayruplánu ‘airplane’ are not because
> they do not occur in this meaning. (To express ‘action of wearing
> trousers’ the prefix pag- must be added to the noun karsúnis:
> Gidilì ang pagkarsúnis dinhi, ‘It is forbidden to wear pants
> here.’ Similarly a pag- must be added to ayruplánu to make a noun
> meaning ‘action of ...’: Ang pag-ayruplánu makapadali sa byáhi,
> ‘Taking a plane hastens the trip.’
> 
> Roots that are basically adjectives are distinguished from noun roots
> in that they occur with a prefix ka- in exclamations to mean ‘how
> very [adjective]!’ whereas nouns do not. Thus buguy ‘tramp’ is an
> adjective because it occurs with ka- in this meaning: kabuguy níya
> ‘what a tramp he is’, whereas kutsi ‘car’ is not. (To express,
> ‘what a car!’ the suffix -a(←) is used, not ka-: Ngilngígang
> kutsíha uy! ‘My! What a car!’)
> 
> [15] The root is taken to be inum because the form containing mu- is
> muinum ‘will drink’.
> 
> [16] However, this is true only of the Cebu City dialect. Other
> dialects retain /ʔC/: kàna /káʔna/ ‘eat it’.
> 
> [17] Dialectally they change to /d/: hadkan, padngan.
> 
> [18] In the strictest sense, of course, no two forms are the same in
> meaning: in English, for example, rather pronounced to rhyme with
> father is different in meaning from rather pronounced [ræd̵ər]. One
> is a strange or affected word and the other is a normal word. But which
> form is normal is all a matter of what part of the country one comes
> from, and a dictionary which is not regionally biased must list them as
> synonymous. Similarly, in Cebuano for any given speaker, where several
> forms compete, usually only one form is normal; but, as in the case of
> the two rather’s in English, the two competing forms are most often
> synonymous from the dictionary’s point of view.
> 
> [19] The existence of forms similar in meaning with initial l and
> initial vowel, e.g. lárag—árag ‘for leaves to fall off’, shows
> that this sound change also crossed morphological boundaries when it
> was in effect.
> 
> [20] Thus, for example: salámat ‘thanks’ is everywhere with /l/
> and a notation to this effect is made in the listing of salámat. But
> for balay ‘house’, for example, we make no entry for báy because
> from the listing of balay with no further comment alone the reader may
> deduce a form báy.
> 
> [21] There are also forms with dy (/j/) which do not come from an older
> /y/, e.g. pangadyi ‘pray’.
> 
> [22] The occurrence of the tense affixation is predictable: a verb form
> which occurs with a given voice-mode affix in one tense occurs also in
> the same voice and mode in the other tenses. The voice, mode, and
> aspect affixes, however, are not predictable. Some verbs occur in one,

> 
> [23] These affixes are the future forms shown in the chart of this

> 
> They may also refer to exhortations:
> 
>     Palitun ta! Let’s buy it!
>     Mupalit tag isdà, Let’s buy some fish.
> 
> The forms designated PAST refer to past actions.

> 
>     Naghilak ang bátà, The child is crying.
>     Naglútù pa siya sa isdà, He is still cooking the fish.
> 
> The forms designated as SUBJUNCTIVE occur in a phrase and following a

> walà ‘not (past)’, anus-a ‘when (future)’, sa miáging
> Duminggu ‘last Sunday’, adtu ‘there (future)’, túa ‘there
> (present)’, and the like.
> 
>     Ugmà níya palita, He will buy it tomorrow.
>     Anus-a nímu palita ang isdà? When will you buy the fish?
>     Didtu níya palita, He bought it there.
>     Sunud Duminggu níya palita, He will buy it next Sunday.
>     Walà níya palita, He did not buy it.
> 
> The passive subjunctive forms are also used as imperative forms:
> 
>     Palita ang isdà! Buy the fish!
>     Ayaw lutúa, Don’t cook it.
>     Limpiyúhi ninyu! You (plural) clean it.
